    "text": "Work in Progress\n\nAutonomous Municipalities in Regional Transit Networks: Is Network Effectiveness Affected? This project explores the governance structures of multi-city transit agencies, focusing on how the option for individual cities to withdraw from the agency impacts ridership. Building on prior qualitative research involving interviews with transit professionals, the study confirms that this governance feature affects transit usage. These findings were presented at the 2023 ABFM conference.\nCollaborative Governance and Revenue Generation: A Study of PILOT Programs in Boston This paper explores the dynamics of Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILOT) programs, focusing on the collaborative process between local governments and tax-exempt entities. Using Boston’s highly regarded PILOT program as a case study, the research examines why cities initiate these programs and how nonprofits respond once they join. The study provides insights into the governance structures that contribute to the success of PILOT programs, highlighting the balance between municipal revenue generation and cooperation with nonprofits. The findings offer valuable lessons for other cities looking to implement or enhance their own PILOT initiatives.\nHarnessing Big Data: Best Practices for Local Governments in Data Collection and Processing This paper explores best practices for the collection, processing, and analysis of big data, with a focus on local government applications. As data generation continues to expand at an unprecedented rate, particularly due to the digitalization of services, the ability to effectively manage and derive insights from this data becomes essential for public sector organizations. Through case studies and a review of current methodologies, this research provides practical strategies for local governments to unlock the potential of big data, while addressing associated challenges such as privacy concerns.\nAddressing the Hollow State: Enhancing Emergency Response through Coproduction This paper examines the concept of the “hollow state,” where traditional government roles in social issues are diminished due to the increased prominence of non-state actors. Specifically, it explores how coproduction—where governments collaborate with non-state actors—can supplement state capacity in delivering public services, particularly in emergency response. By analyzing the evolving role of non-state actors in the U.S. and the UK, the paper investigates whether coproduction is more effective than exclusive government provision and evaluates its impact on emergency services. The research highlights the potential benefits and challenges of this collaborative approach in strengthening state responses to crises.\nParticipation Without Citizenship: Exploring Civic Involvement of Non-Naturalized Immigrants This qualitative research explores the political participation of non-naturalized immigrants in the United States. Through participant observation of immigrants at political demonstrations and in-depth interviews with immigrants engaged in politics and government workers supporting immigrant integration, the study investigates the dynamics of political involvement among this group. The research delves into how various factors, such as legal consciousness and socioeconomic status influence their engagement. By examining these interactions and experiences, the study aims to provide nuanced insights into the challenges and opportunities for non-naturalized immigrants in participating in the political sphere."

    "text": "The topic of the proposed research is the theory-practice gap in public transit. This gap is well documented in the Urban Planning scholarship, but research on the extent of this gap in the public transit scholarship is lacking. However, a growing body of literature in the Urban Planning field suggest that transit decision-makers enact policies that go against the recommendations of transit experts.\nIn relation to this, transit governance has been proposed as a factor that may increase the divide between experts and decision-makers. More specifically, studies focusing on regional transit agencies have found that local autonomy, which is the ability of a municipality to leave a network, negatively affect agencies’ output. Most of those studies are qualitative. I am currently working on a research project studying 84 transit agencies in the 16 largest metropolitan areas in the United States. The preliminary results support the qualitative studies as agencies facing local autonomy have lower performances than those that do not. However, the project did not specifically investigate the level of tension between decision-makers and experts.\nThe present research thus seeks to fill this gap by determining whether a gap exists between theory and practice, and whether the gap is greater for transit agencies facing local autonomy."

Code was provided to help others replicate the results.\nThe study revealed interesting patterns that can be explored further. For example, media outlets tend to mention Trump more than Harris in their YouTube content, especially after the election results were announced. CNN, however, seemed to offer balanced coverage of both Trump and Harris before election day. After the results were published, CNN, like other media, reduced coverage of Harris. Another notable difference with CNN is that, after the results were announced, they used more neutral terms like “results” or “election” and less frequently mentioned “Trump.”"

Consequently, media coverage has likely focused more extensively on him. Further analyses in the sections below will help to either support or refute this hypothesis."

Code was provided to help others replicate the results.\nThe study revealed interesting patterns that can be explored further. For example, media outlets tend to mention Trump more than Harris in their YouTube content, especially after the election results were announced. CNN, however, seemed to offer balanced coverage of both Trump and Harris before election day. After the results were published, CNN, like other media, reduced coverage of Harris. Another notable difference with CNN is that, after the results were announced, they used more neutral terms like “results” or “election” and less frequently mentioned “Trump.”"

I suspect this is because, as of November 18, 2024, Donald Trump had been announced as the election winner nearly two weeks prior. Consequently, media coverage has likely focused more extensively on him. Further analyses in the sections below will help to either support or refute this hypothesis."

    "text": "Concluding Remarks\nThis project aimed to demonstrate the use of NLP techniques for conducting an exploratory data analysis of YouTube content. Code was provided to help others replicate the results.\nThe study revealed interesting patterns that can be explored further. For example, media outlets tend to mention Trump more than Harris in their YouTube content, especially after the election results were announced. CNN, however, seemed to offer balanced coverage of both Trump and Harris before election day. After the results were published, CNN, like other media, reduced coverage of Harris. Another notable difference with CNN is that, after the results were announced, they used more neutral terms like “results” or “election” and less frequently mentioned “Trump.”"
