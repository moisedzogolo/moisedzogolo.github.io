    "text": "The topic of the proposed research is the theory-practice gap in public transit. This gap is well documented in the Urban Planning scholarship, but research on the extent of this gap in the public transit scholarship is lacking. However, a growing body of literature in the Urban Planning field suggest that transit decision-makers enact policies that go against the recommendations of transit experts.\nIn relation to this, transit governance has been proposed as a factor that may increase the divide between experts and decision-makers. More specifically, studies focusing on regional transit agencies have found that local autonomy, which is the ability of a municipality to leave a network, negatively affect agencies’ output. Most of those studies are qualitative. I am currently working on a research project studying 84 transit agencies in the 16 largest metropolitan areas in the United States. The preliminary results support the qualitative studies as agencies facing local autonomy have lower performances than those that do not. However, the project did not specifically investigate the level of tension between decision-makers and experts.\nThe present research thus seeks to fill this gap by determining whether a gap exists between theory and practice, and whether the gap is greater for transit agencies facing local autonomy."
